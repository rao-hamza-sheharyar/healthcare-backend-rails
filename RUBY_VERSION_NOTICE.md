# ⚠️ Ruby Version Notice

## Current Issue

The system has **Ruby 2.7.0** but **Rails 8.1 requires Ruby 3.1+**.

## Solutions

### Option 1: Use rbenv (Recommended)

```bash
# Install rbenv
curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash

# Add to ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# Install Ruby 3.2.4
rbenv install 3.2.4

# Set as local version
cd healthcare-backend-rails
rbenv local 3.2.4

# Now try again
bundle install
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
rails server
```

### Option 2: Use Docker

```bash
cd healthcare-backend-rails
docker-compose up
```

This will:
- Use PostgreSQL
- Run with correct Ruby version in container
- Auto-setup database

### Option 3: Downgrade Rails (Not Recommended)

Change Gemfile to use Rails 7.x which supports Ruby 2.7, but you'll lose Rails 8.1 features.

## Frontends Are Ready

The three frontend applications are already started and running on their respective ports. They just need the backend API to be available.

## Current Status

✅ **Frontends**: All 3 are running (or can be started with `npm run dev`)
❌ **Backend**: Needs Ruby 3.1+ to run

## Quick Fix

After installing Ruby 3.2.4 with rbenv:
```bash
cd healthcare-backend-rails
rbenv local 3.2.4
bundle install
rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
rails server
```

Then the frontends can connect to the API!
